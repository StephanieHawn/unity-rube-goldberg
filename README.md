 ## Takeaways
 * The hardest part was making sure the ball was talking correctly to the stars and hand interaction scripts. There was a lot of moving parts. Also, some of the menu items were hard to figure out - if to use OnTriggerEnter/Stay or OnColissionEnter. Also, couldn't get a prefab script to pull in a public GameObject while it was a prefab?? I had to solve using a shortcut until I can figure it out.
